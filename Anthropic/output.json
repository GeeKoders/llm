        "Provides 4000-4500 daily calories",

    },
    "score": 4,
    "reasoning": "While the solution provides a structured meal plan with good nutritional intent, it fails to meet key quantitative criteria around total caloric intake and precise macronutrient ratios. The plan demonstrates nutritional knowledge but does not fully align with the specified performance nutrition requirements for an ultra-endurance athlete."
